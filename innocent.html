         <p>THE FEAR OF SUCCESS Can one be afraid of succeeding? 
            Isn’t success something that everyone craves? These might be some of the questions racing through
             your mind at the sight of this theme. Although this might sound illusory, the fear of success 
             is very real and has the potential of holding one back. The fear of success also can be referred
              to as achievmephobia or success phobia, a state where you have an ongoing fear of succeeding, it is 
              the concern that once you achieve something new, you make lack the ability to sustain them or may suffer
               because of it. and it can inadvertently be self-sabotaging. This fear is often caused by the uncertainties
               that we think might be associated with our success. • What if I experience social or emotional isolation? • What if people around me start 
               thinking that I’m excessively proud? • What if my success causes me to be detached from my peers? Et cetera. These
                uncertainties make us procrastinate, set the bar low for ourselves, and sometimes quit when we are on the verge of 
                succeeding. The fear of success can be very subtle, and it takes a high level of self-awareness to identify your own. 
                Why don’t you take that bold step today and overcome those fears and anxieties? Oh yes! there are so many uncertainties
                 associated with reaching out for new heights, but would you rather remain at your current level? It’s totally up
